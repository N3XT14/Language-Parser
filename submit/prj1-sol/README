### Language Algorithms

Algorithm works on two concepts i.e peek, consume. (though these words are not used as it is)

Peek: We peek at the current token and sibling tokens for the desired declaration.
Consume: If desired declaration are found then it is consumed inside the stack.

In case a peek is failed which may be due to couple of reasons like invalid value, end of tokens, improper declaration of sequence, then in that case a suitable error messgae is thrown towards the standard output.
